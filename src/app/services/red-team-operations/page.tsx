            <Text align="center" mb="lg">
                    A Red Team Assessment is an advanced security exercise where our experts simulate an adversary attempting to breach your systems, evade defenses, and achieve their objectives. Unlike a traditional penetration test, Red Team Assessments are broader in scope and aim to challenge your entire organizationâ€”from your technical defenses to the response capabilities of your security team.
